// Created by Offroaders123 for the Dark Mode resource pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

// Textures have been created by Offroaders123, Vattic, and xMrVizzy.
// Textures are from the Bedrock Edition vanilla resource pack / Offroaders123's Faithful 32x resource pack with a darker shade applied.
// Some textures originated from Vattic and xMrVizzy's Faithful 32x resource pack, so credit is due to them!
